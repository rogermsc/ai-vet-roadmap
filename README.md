# AI Veterinary Diagnostics Roadmap

A technical framework for developing and implementing AI-powered diagnostic solutions in veterinary healthcare.

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive roadmap for product managers, data scientists, and veterinary professionals collaborating on AI diagnostic tools. It combines strategic product planning with technical implementation guidance specifically tailored for veterinary applications.

## Key Features

- **Strategic Roadmapping**: Templates and frameworks for planning AI product development in veterinary diagnostics
- **Technical Implementation**: Code samples, model architectures, and data processing pipelines
- **Veterinary Domain Knowledge**: Species-specific considerations and diagnostic requirements
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Methods to assess model performance against veterinary standards
- **Deployment Guides**: Technical approaches for integrating AI into veterinary workflows

## Repository Structure

- **`/src`**: Core implementation code and utilities
- **`/docs`**: Technical documentation and strategic frameworks
- **`/templates`**: Product roadmap and planning templates
- **`/models`**: Model architectures and pre-trained examples
- **`/data`**: Sample datasets and data processing scripts
- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and demonstration
- **`/examples`**: End-to-end implementation examples
- **`/resources`**: Additional references and learning materials

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Product Strategy Guide](./docs/product_strategy_guide.md) to understand the overall approach
2. Explore the [Technical Requirements](./docs/technical_requirements.md) for AI in veterinary diagnostics
